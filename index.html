					<b>No need to switch to a behemoth Markdown editor just to take a quick note.</b>
					QuickDown's <i>"Less, but better"</i> approach helps you take notes while you stay focused and avoid distractions.
				<p>
					<b>It's an ideal companion to your preferred knowledge base</b>
				such as
				Obsidian, Notion, LogSeq, OneNote, VS Code, TiddlyWiki, Zettlr, Vim, Emacs, iA Writer (and any other text editor, really.)
