					<b>Capture a new idea with ONE GLOBAL HOTKEY that works anywhere and anytime.</b>

					<b>Your notes are saved locally as plain text Markdown files.</b> As such, they're fully backup-able and future-proof. You can store them in any folder you want, like iCloud, Google Drive and OneDrive.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Save time with custom markdown templates for new notes.</b> Control your cursor-placement and automatically pre-fill them with live-variables such as today's date, time, and an auto-incremented ID.
