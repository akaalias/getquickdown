				<p>
					<b>To capture a new idea, you have one global hotkey that works anywhere and anytime.</b>

					Your cursor is immediately focused to go from idea to typing your first letter in 0.42ms or less.

					<b>Your notes are saved locally as plain text Markdown files.</b> As such, they're fully backup-able and future-proof. You can store them in any folder you want including iCloud, Google drive, DropBox and OneDrive.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Save time with custom markdown templates for new notes.</b> Pre-fill your note with live-variables like today's date, time, an auto-incrementing ID. And control <i>exactly</i> where you want your cursor to be placed when you start writing.

				<h2><b>"Note-Taking"</b></h2>
				<p>
					<b>No need to switch to a behemoth markdown editor just to take a quick note.</b>
					To keep you focused and avoid distraction, QuickDown is intentionally bare-bones and only appears when you really need it.
				<p>
					<b>It is a lightweight companion to your preferred knowledge base</b> like Obsidian, LogSeq, VS Code, iA Writer, Zettlr, and TiddlyWiki (or any other plain-text based writing process, really.)

					<p><b>HEY THERE!</b></p>
					<p>Alexis here, great to meet you!</p>

					<p>I'm an avid Obsidian user and constant pen-and-paper note-taker.</p>

					<p>Taking a quick note with pen and paper is fast and easy, right?</p>

					<p>That's when I had to ask myself:</p>

					<p class="center-text"><u>WHY ON EARTH IS TAKING A SIMPLE DIGITAL NOTE STILL SO UTTERLY AWKWARD AND DISTRACTING?!</u></p>

					<p>–––</p>

					<p>Even for jotting down a single sentence you'd have to...</p>

					<p>1. <i>Launch</i> Obsidian (or another full-blown Markdown editor)</p>
					<p>2. <i>Switch</i> my current focus to Obsidian</p>
					<p>3. <i>Ignore</i> a thousand tempting rabbit-holes (My notes)</p>
					<p>4. <i>Create</i> a new note</p>
					<p>5. <i>Leave</i> my keyboard</p>
					<p>6. <i>Mouse-click</i> to focus the correct pane</p>
					<p>7. <i>Switch back</i> to my keyboard</p>
					<p>8. <i>Write</i> a few lines</p>
					<p>9. <i>Switch back</i> to what I was working on before the idea appeared</p>

					<p>This is 2022 and that's an INSANE amount of steps, you know?!</p>

					<p>–––</p>

					<p>For me, Obsidian is <i>perfect for "LATER"</i>.</p>

					<p>"LATER", when I flesh out notes, connect ideas, write a first draft, edit.</p>

					<p>But until then, <u>all I need is to capture my idea NOW. And IN ONE GO</u>.</p>

					<p>And none of the existing native note-taking apps had what I needed.</p>

					<p>–––</p>

					<p>So I made my own app that lets me take a note without losing focus:</p>

					<p>1. A single global hotkey <code>⌘-⌥-N</code> pops up a new note <i>and</i> focuses my cursor</p>
					<p>2. A simple <code>⌘-S</code> saves the markdown note to my Obsidian vault</p>
					<p>3. A simple <code>Esc</code> dismisses the popover</p>

					<p>To type even less boilerplate, I added custom templates and live-variables.</p>

					<p>–––</p>

					<p>QuickDown is <i>the least-frills way</i> to jot down a markdown note.</p>

					<p>And that's it.</p>

					<p>Nothing more, nothing less.<p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>And I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.<p>

					<p>Cheers and with best wishes!</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>PS: The app is free and completely open-source!<p>
