					QuickDown is built from the ground up to <i>feel and work</i> like a pen-and-paper notepad.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Capture a new idea with ONE GLOBAL HOTKEY that works anywhere and anytime.</b>

					Your cursor is immediately focused to go from idea to typing your first letter in 0.42ms or less.

				<h2 class="heading">Save To Markdown</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Your notes are saved locally as plain text Markdown files.</b> As such, they're fully backup-able and future-proof. You can store them in any folder you want including iCloud, Google drive, DropBox and OneDrive.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Save time with custom markdown templates for new notes.</b> Pre-fill your note with live-variables like today's date, time, an auto-incrementing ID. And control <i>exactly</i> where you want your cursor to be placed when you start writing.

				<h2 class="heading">Keep Your Focus</h2>
				<p>
					<b>No need to switch to a behemoth Markdown editor just to take a quick note.</b>
					To keep you focused and avoid distraction, QuickDown is intentionally bare-bones and only appears when you really need it.
				<p>
					<b>It is a lightweight companion to your preferred knowledge base</b>
				such as
				Obsidian, LogSeq, Microsoft OneNote, VS Code, TiddlyWiki, Zettlr, Vim, Emacs, iA Writer, MacDown and any other plain text editor, really.
