				<h2><b>"Keyboard-First"</b></h2>
				<p>
					Just like a real notepad, QuickDown is built from the ground up to <b>feel like pen-and-paper</b>. To capture a new idea, you have <b>one global hotkey</b> that works anywhere and anytime: <u>Option-Command-N</u>
				</p>
				<p>
					Your cursor is <b>immediately focused</b> to go from idea to typing your first letter in 0.42ms or less.  Write, edit and save your ideas to Markdown files <b>without ever leaving your keyboard.</b>

				<h2><b>"Local Markdown"</b></h2>
				<p>
					Upon saving, your notes are <b>stored locally as plain text Markdown</b> files in any folder you choose.
				</p>
				<p>
					As plain text files they can be directly saved to your <b>iCloud, Google drive, DropBox and OneDrive.</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					To save you time, <b>new notes can be fully customized with templates.</b> Include your preferred structure with YAML frontmatter, headers, lists, quotes, placeholders, tags or anything else you know you need.
